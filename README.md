## URLs
The defualt port for this project is `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. But, I made the URL for Users: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/users`. You can either use the default or custom URL for Users. The task is only show the users and add a user. Furthermore, I will also implement for update and delete operations. :)
